    <p><em>A Taco is a traditional Mexican food consisting of a small hand-sized corn- or wheat-based tortilla topped with a filling.</em>
</p>     
<br>
<p><em>Burritos are filled with savory ingredients, most often a meat such as beef, chicken, or pork, and often include other ingredients, 
    such as rice, cooked beans (either whole or refried), vegetables, such as lettuce,tomatoes, onions, cheese, and condiments such 
    as salsa, pico de gallo, guacamole, or crema.</em> </p>
<br>
<p><em>Dessert is a course that concludes a meal. The course consists of sweet foods, such as confections, and possibly a 
    beverage such as dessert wine and liqueur. In some parts of the world, such as much of Central Africa and West Africa, 
    and most parts of China, there is no tradition of a dessert course to conclude a meal.</em></p>
